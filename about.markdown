Hi, I'm Nick.  I studied abstract mathematics and theoretical physics as an undergraduate, and I'm 
trying to become a Data Scientist.  I intend to do so independently, though grad school is 
necessarily on the table (once I find a cool 15-g's to pay for it).  Most of my undergraduate success
was attained in isolation, so I believe I can succeed.  Besides, I've come too far to fail.


Projects I complete to this end will be uploaded to this site to assist in showcasing both my 
relevant competencies, as well as my continued growth in this field.  Some of it will not be
impressive, but some of it, someday, will be.

Thanks for taking the time to look around.


note: this is still (11/30/2022) the initial commit to github pages, and as such does not yet house
      content.  stay tuned.
